## Introduction
This is a workout tracking application that allows users to create and edit workouts. The workout data is stored in a Mongo database system where it can be retrieved for viewing on a statistics page.

## Usage

The Fitness Tracker can be utilized by users in order to keep track of workout progress. Users can create and add exercises to a workout. The data is then stored in a Mongo database and displayed in a stats page for users to keep track of their progress. The application divides exercises into two types: resistance and cardio. The stats page has graphs and pie charts to easily view progress for both types over a 7 day period. A video demonstration of the functionality of the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/rr_bbYyAYlw).
